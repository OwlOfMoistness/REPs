## Abstract

This introduces an extension to ERC721 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to provide contexts and to differentiate owner and ownership rights for a token.

## Motivation

Developing on top of ERC721 has often posed challenges, as many decentralized applications (dApps) recognize token ownership as proof that the owner is entitled to benefits within the protocol, such as airdrops or tiered rewards. Because there is only an Owner role indicating for the ownership rights.

This proposal can facilitate serval use cases, including mortgage, rental, staking, delegating, and more by contextualizing the use case and distinguishing ownership rights from other roles at the standard level. By standardizing these measures, developers can more easily construct infrastructure and protocols on top of this standard.

## Specification

### Token Context

The token context provides a specified use case of a token, where tokens can be delegated to users to use in a certain context. Token users can be optionally set by context controllers, in cases of they are not set, the token owner is referenced by default.

Context controllers have the ability to (un)lock an attached token.

### Token Master

The primary function of this role is to distinguish between owner and ownership rights, primarily focusing on holding ownership rights, which involve permission such as transferring ownership and managing the addition or removal of tokens from contexts.

Token master is updated when:

- Token transferred: the address will be referenced to the new owner.
- Master renounced: the address will be referenced to the current owner.
- Role transferred: the address will be referenced to the new token master.

### Token Locking

A token can be (un)locked from transferring by any attached context.

The locking mechanism can be disabled if the token masters request to detach their tokens from contexts, but their requests must be delayed for security reasons. If the token is not locked by any context, the request can be invoked immediately.

### Roles

| Roles             | Permission                                                                                                               | Quantity per Token |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Owner             | • Default `User` of all contexts                                                                                         | $1$                |
| Master            | • Transfers `Master` role<br>• Transfers `Owner` role<br>• Attaches/detaches their token to/from 1 or many `Context`     | $1$                |
| **Context Roles** |                                                                                                                          | $n$                |
| Controller        | • Transfers `Controller` role<br>• Grants a `User` role<br>• (Un)locks transfers<br>• Detaches a token from this context | $1$ per context    |
| User              | • Transfers `User`                                                                                                       | $1$ per context    |

Each role holder can transfer their role to another account to maintain the operation, except the owner.

## Security Consideration

## Detaching delay time

When developing a token intended to serve multiple contexts, the contract deployer should anticipate potential use cases and establish an appropriate delay time for detaching tokens from contexts. This precaution is essential to mitigate the risk of the owner and token master abusing rental/mortgage systems by spamming listings and transferring tokens to another owner in a short time.

## Duplicated token usage

When initiating a new context, the context controllers should track all other contexts within the NFT contract to prevent duplicated usage.

For example, suppose a scenario where a token is locked for rental purposes within a particular game. If that game introduces another context, it could lead to duplicated token usage within the game, despite being intended for different contexts.

## Typical Use Cases

### Mortgage

![Mortgage Flow](./assets/mortgage.png)

This is a typical use case for mortgages, supposing A(owner) owns a token and wants to mortgage, and B(lender) wants to earn interest by lending their funds to A.

### Rental

![Rental Flow](./assets/rental.png)

This is a typical use case for rentals, supposing A(owner) owns a token and wants to list his/her token for rent, and B(user) wants to rent the token to play in a certain game.
