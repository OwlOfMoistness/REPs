## Abstract

We are adding a method to allow the validators to exit early during maintenance mode.

## Rationale

At times, validators may need to enter maintenance mode while upgrading versions or addressing technical issues. However, predicting the duration of maintenance can be challenging. Therefore, we are introducing a new method that enables validators to exit early during maintenance mode.

## Specification

We have implemented a method that enables validators to exit maintenance mode early, allowing them to resume block production as usual in the next epoch.

When a validator intends to enter maintenance mode, they can schedule maintenance for a sufficiently long period. Upon completing the necessary maintenance tasks on their node, they can use the new method to exit maintenance mode."
